# FlashCards
A simple flash cards app :)

## Usage
Import this project to Android Studio to use it (it's still very work in progress).

## Options
You can add questions and answers and then train your knowledge with them.
When you start you'll be shown the questions and will have to type the answer.
You can then check if it's right. 
If the answer is wrong you can try again or click 'show' to see the right answer.
You can also skip questions.
Once you can answer a question without problems you can delete it.

There is a Training Mode and a Competitive Mode.
The Training Mode offers the functions mentioned above.
The Competitive has the added functions of a timer, showing how fast you can answer all questions, 
and a counter for questions you have answered correct, wrong and questions you have skipped.
